## Hi there 👋 I'm Rakuuudev

🌱 Learning Journey:
I'm currently diving into web development — building up my skills in HTML and CSS, and just starting to explore JavaScript. Every day is a new lesson!

🎯 Next Goals:

    Get comfortable with JavaScript
    Build my first web projects
    Document my learning along the way

💡 About Me:
I may not have any professional experience or standout projects yet, but I'm passionate about tech and always eager to learn something new. My GitHub will be home to my experiments and progress as I grow.

    “The expert in anything was once a beginner.”

Thanks for stopping by!
Feel free to check back for updates as I grow and build more.
